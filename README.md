# ELIXIR: Learning from User Feedback on Explanations to Improve Recommender Models

## Overview
ELIXIR is a human-in-the-loop framework for incorporating users’ feedback on pairs of recommendations and explanations into a given recommendation model. In our paper, we instantiate ELIXIR for a state-of-the-art HIN-based recommender, [RecWalk](https://www.nikolako.net/papers/ACM_WSDM2019_RecWalk.pdf) as a representative of a family of the recommender systems with random walk at their core.
The following figure shows the workflow of ELIXIR. First, a recommendation model is learned based on users’ history of interactions and item-item similarities (step 1). Each recommendation is explained by a set of items with which the user has already interacted. These items are interpreted as the most contributing ones towards the relevance of the recommended item to the user. The set of generated recommendations and explanations are then shown to the user (step 2), where they can rate the recommendations and give feedback on similar aspects of the recommendations and explanations. As the pair-level feedback is expected to be highly sparse, we use label propagation to densify it (step 3). Using the resulting set of pair-level feedback, a user specific preference vector wu is learned (step 4) which is used to update the items’ representations (step 5) and the item-item similarity matrix subsequently (step 6). The updated item-item similarity matrix is fed to the recommendation model (here RecWalk), the model is updated accordingly and finally a new set of recommendations are generated for the user (step 7).
