from the users in the first phase of the study to initiate initiate their 
profiles. Each line captures one user-item interaction (or rating). 
The ratings are on a scale of 1 to 5 (with 5 interpreted as liking very 
much and 1 as not liking at all).

- phase2-rec-ratings.txt: In the second phase of the study, users were 
provided with 30 recommendations generated by the recommendation model 
trained on their initial ratings. This file contains users’ ratings for 
the generated recommendations. In column “aspects”, we store a summary 
of the features of the recommended movies which were shown to the users 
to help them cue their memory

- phase2-pair-ratings.txt: In this file, we list users’ feedback on pairs 
of recommendations and explanations. Each line contains information about
the user, the recommendation item (item1), its explanation item (item2),
user’s feedback on similar aspects of the recommendation and the explanation
(1 and -1 mean like and dislike, respectively), similar aspects of the 
recommendation and the explanation item shown to help users with their 
decision (column “aspects”), user’s answer to the question “What do (don't) 
you like about the similar aspects of the recommendation and the explanation?” 
(column “liked/disliked-aspects”) and optional comments of the user (column “comment”).

- phase3-rec-ratings.txt: In the third phase of the study, we first 
incorporated users’ feedback on individual as well as pair of items collected in 
the second phase. Then, using the updated model, we generated top 30 recommendations, 
this time for 5 different configurations as described in the paper, and asked users 
to rate them on a scale of 1-5. This file contains the corresponding user ratings.

- movies-features.txt: In this file, we store features of the movies crawled 
from the movielens.org website. Each element of the list is a dictionary

movielens users’ voting for the tags), link, name, description and year of release 
of the movie.

goodreads.com. Here, the data is stored as a list of dictionaries, where each 
dictionary has information (such as title, authors and genres) about a book.
